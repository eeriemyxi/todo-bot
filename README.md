# Introduction
A basic to-do bot for Discord. Supports GNU-style flags. Meant to be self-hosted and used by one individual person.

This is pretty much for my personal use, but I opine that it is bad practice to hardcode stuff. So I made it at least somewhat usable by anybody who would want to.

# Installation
I will write the instructions later.
